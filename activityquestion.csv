	Imagine memory as a muscle, lifting things from your subconscious to your conscious, like a weightlifter
hauling up weights.
</p><p>Lifting things back into your conscious takes muscles. But sometimes we try to remember things – to lift them
into the light – without practising lifting. No wonder we find it exhausting! Often pupils who haven’t practised
lifting enough say, 
	<strong><em>“I have a terrible memory,”</em></strong> or <strong><em>“I can never remember anything.”</em> </strong>What they mean is <strong><em>“I
haven’t practised recalling things enough.” 
	</em></strong>
</p><p>And here’s the good news – you can make lifting easier!
</p><p>Have a go at this simple (and not very serious!) experiment. Below are two lists of twenty words each.

yourself,
	<strong><em> ""how much control do I have over this?""</em></strong> Is it

	<li><strong>No control </strong>– there is nothing you can do about it (e.g.
external factors such as ill health or family problems)?

out of your control but there are some things that you could do to make it better? 
	</li>
	<li><strong>In my control  -  </strong>Something you have full control over, perhaps only limited by your own motivation (e.g. you might not have been working hard enough but you know there aren’t really
any excuses for this)?

We use the word ‘dashboard’ to mean what you see first thing in the morning or last thing at night. It might be the wall above your desk or next to your bedside table. It might be the wallpaper on your phone or the inside cover of your files. We each live with a mental dashboard of people and ideas. Our research shows us that people who have even a brief reminder of a positive role model – from looking at their dashboard – have hugely increased levels of motivation.
</p><p>We have worked with many students who have created or altered their dashboards:
</p><ul>
	<li>One student put a photograph of the university she wanted to go to inside her file, so she saw it each time she opened it up to work.</li>
	<li>Another student covered his bedroom wall with inspiring quotes and messages.</li>
