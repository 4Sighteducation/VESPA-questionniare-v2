Watch for</p><p>feedback after a sporting fixture, and see how players react. Watch out for how your parents describe taking</p><p>feedback, or even your teachers. Most of all, watch for how your friends talk about feedback. If you’re</p><p>surrounded by people who can’t take feedback, it makes it harder to learn how to handle it well.</p><p>Austin Kleon (2014), a writer and artist, warns us to make sure we have positive friends. He calls negative friends</p><p>‘vampires’. Kleon advises that, “if, after hanging out with someone you feel worn out and depleted, that person is</p><p>a vampire. If, after hanging out with someone you still feel full of energy, that person is not a vampire.”</p><p>It’s worth thinking about the fve people you spend most time with, and asking yourself fve questions</p><p>about them ...</p><p>1. Are they positive people?</p><p>2. Do they enjoy their lives?</p><p>3. Are they a good influence?</p><p>4. Have they helped you through problems?</p><p>5.
